### About Me

I started my career as an illustrator two years ago. After one year of work, I improved my skills and began working on animation projects in a company with a large team of animators, storyboard artists and scriptwriters. Working as an illustrator gave me the opportunity to realize my creative potential, taught me to work effectively in a team, not to be afraid to think creatively and to take responsibility in solving complex problems, and I got the skills to work in graphic programs ans also I improved my communication skills in English because I worked for an international company.  

In my spare time I started learn Frontend Development because this sphere is like creativity,  gives the opportunity to create projects that improve people’s lives and make it comfortable, and unlimited opportunities for professional growth and development of their skills with a view to establishing their personal projects in the future. I also have a bachelor’s degree in design that helps me make quality and user-friendly interfaces.
